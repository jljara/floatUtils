Description: These functions are useful to work with the normal mathematical
    intuition when using floating-point numbers. For example, the result of the
    following expression is not intuitive for all people:
    > (0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1) == 1
    [1] FALSE
    It would normally be expected that adding 0.1 ten times would add up to 1,
    but due to finite-length representation of float number, this is not the
    case in a computer.
    Thus, problems might arise when comparing, for example, the time instants
    in which a signal was sampled. If the signal mean value for the second
    minute of a recording sampled at 100 Hz is required, then the relevant
    time instants must be located. It would be risky to try
    \code{which(time == 60.01)} and \code{which(time == 120.00)}, for the
    reasons given above. It would be more appropriate to use, for example,
    \code{which(are.tolerably.equal(time, 60.01, 1 / 1000))} and
    \code{which(are.tolerably.equal(time, 120, 1 / 1000))} respectively.
